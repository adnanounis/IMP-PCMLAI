# Datasheet for Breast Cancer Wisonsin (Original) Data set



## Motivation

- For what purpose was the dataset created? 
The dataset was created to record biological measurements related to the classification of benign or malignant cancerous cells in the chest area. (Breast Cancer) from clinical cases in Wisconsin.
- Who created the dataset (e.g., which team, research group) and on behalf of which entity (e.g., company, institution, organization)? Who funded the creation of the dataset?
The dataset was created by Dr. William Wolberg as part of his clinical cases. The dataset was initially created with 367 instances in January 1989. More instances were added periodically up until November 1991.

 
## Composition

- What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent (e.g., documents, photos, people, countries)? 
Each instance represents biological measurements for an individual. (Sample code number, Clump Thickness, Uniformity of Cell Size, Uniformity of Cell Shape, Marginal Adhesion, Single Epithelial Cell Size, Bare Nuclei, Bland Chromatin, Normal Nuceoli, Mitoses and Class)
- How many instances of each type are there?
There are 699 total instances 
- Is there any missing data?
Yes
- Does the dataset contain data that might be considered confidential (e.g., data that is protected by legal privilege or by    doctor–patient confidentiality, data that includes the content of individuals’ non-public communications)?
The dataset contains the medical information for different patients. Since the data was made public, it is assumed that the patients have provided their consent for the use of this data given that this dataset is also licensed under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.

## Collection process

- How was the data acquired? 
The data was recorded during clinical cases. 
- If the data is a sample of a larger subset, what was the sampling strategy? 
Not applicable
- Over what time frame was the data collected?
The initial dataset was created in January 1989 and the dataset was periodically updated to include new instances up until November of 1991.

## Preprocessing/cleaning/labelling

- Was any preprocessing/cleaning/labeling of the data done (e.g., discretization or bucketing, tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, SIFT feature extraction, removal of instances, processing of missing values)? If so, please provide a description. If not, you may skip the remaining questions in this section. 
The data was revised in Jan 10,1991 and in Nov 22, 1991. Some instances have been removed and others have updated.
- Was the “raw” data saved in addition to the preprocessed/cleaned/labeled data (e.g., to support unanticipated future uses)? 
 No

## Uses

- What other tasks could the dataset be used for? 
The dataset is only used for breast cancer identification.
- Is there anything about the composition of the dataset or the way it was collected and preprocessed/cleaned/labeled that might impact future uses? For example, is there anything that a dataset consumer might need to know to avoid uses that could result in unfair treatment of individuals or groups (e.g., stereotyping, quality of service issues) or other risks or harms (e.g., legal risks, financial harms)? If so, please provide a description. Is there anything a dataset consumer could do to mitigate these risks or harms? 
 Nothing of the data can be used to immediately identify any of the patients whose data is in this dataset.
- Are there tasks for which the dataset should not be used? If so, please provide a description.
This dataset was mainly created from patient data in Wisconsin. This dataset should not be used as a global dataset for breast cancer identification or any other form of cancer identification. It is only applicable for breat cancer study in populations within that area only.

## Distribution

- How has the dataset already been distributed? 
The dataset is publicy available on the internet. It can be found in UC Irvine's Machine Learning Repository:https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/15/breast+cancer+wisconsin+original
- Is it subject to any copyright or other intellectual property (IP) license, and/or under applicable terms of use (ToU)?  
Yes this dataset is covered by CC BY 4.0 License

## Maintenance

- Who maintains the dataset?
The dataset was donated to UC Irvine's Machine learning Repository on 7/14/1992. It is assumed that they have been maintaining it since then.
